	<br/><p>Hi, I'm Dmitriy and this is my portfolio style webpage where I share about my career and insterests.<br/>
	I'm a software engineer specializing in embedded camera software development, specifically vehicle camera applications such as <b>Around View Monitoring</b> often referred as <b>Surround View Monitoring</b>. Moreover I have an experience in developing camera framework for mobile cameras. Specifically, I have worked on <b>ISP</b> (Image Signal Processor) module for <b>LG G3 Screen</b> model.<br/>
	Lately, <b>Deep Learning</b> has become my major field of interest. Deep Learing is fascinating and fits well for developers with image signal processing background. In my university years I've researched various image quality enhancement and image compression algorithms. Deep Learning addresses these problems while taking a innovative approach. Denoising autoencoders are of my particular interest. To learn more about my Deep Learning research please go to <a href="links/project.html">Project</a>.</p>
